# Prompt: Resolve Risk Register Items

## Required Reading
1. `docs/20251018/codex-sdk-completion/risk-mitigation.md`
2. `docs/08-tdd-implementation-guide.md` (risk section)
3. Relevant documentation per risk entry (e.g., fixtures, tool registry, approvals).
4. CI configurations and Mix tasks related to verification.

## Implementation Instructions
1. Select an open risk from the tracker and analyze mitigation steps.
2. Draft failing tests or scripts that expose the risk if unhandled (e.g., fixture drift detection, approval deadlock scenario).
3. Implement the mitigation with TDD, ensuring the new tests capture the resolved behavior.
4. Update automation or CI pipelines as necessary (e.g., add verification steps, telemetry alerts).
5. Document the resolution by updating the risk tracker status and adding any new operational guidance.
6. Run all tests and verification commands, confirming zero warnings and a green build before marking the risk as mitigated.
